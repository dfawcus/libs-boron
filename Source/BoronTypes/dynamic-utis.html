<div class="entry-content"><p>If you’re a Mac or iOS developer, you’ve probably heard of UTIs; if you
come from some other platform, you probably haven’t, so I’ll start with
a quick overview.</p>

<p>UTI stands for Uniform Type Identifier, and it’s used in a similar way
to a MIME type—it’s a name for a particular kind of data—but unlike
MIME types, UTIs are based on reverse DNS syntax strings (with two
notable exceptions, which we’ll get to in a minute).  If you want a new
MIME type, you either have to register it with IETF, which is
time-consuming <em>and</em> a source of uncertainty (they might not agree that
you need one), <em>or</em> you can stick an <code>x-</code> prefix on it (but this might
create clashes).  If you want a UTI, however, all you need do is own an
Internet domain; if you own <code>example.com</code>, you also own all of the UTI
namespace starting <code>com.example</code>, so you could use <code>com.example.MyDataType</code>.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with MIME types, you’ll also know that they’re split
into two pieces, separated by a ‘/’ character.  For instance, <code>text/plain</code>
or <code>image/jpeg</code>.  The part before the ‘/’ is supposed to tell you what
<em>kind</em> of data you’re dealing with.  This is useful, but it really doesn’t
give you that much information; for instance, if you have a MIME type
starting <code>text/</code>, you know it’s <em>some</em> kind of text, but you don’t really
know how to decode it, or even if it’s compatible with US-ASCII.</p>

<p>UTIs, on the other hand, have a conformance hierarchy, so it’s possible
to tell the system that your wonderful new data format,
<code>com.example.MyDataType</code>, is actually a kind of video file.  Moreover,
you can be specific about it; maybe it’s actually a special kind of
MPEG file.  How does this work?  Well, Apple has reserved all UTIs
starting <code>public.</code>, and has defined a large set of standard UTIs in
that space.  For instance, <code>public.jpeg</code> conforms to <code>public.image</code>,
which in turn conforms to <code>public.data</code>, which, in turn, conforms to
<code>public.item</code>.  There’s actually more than one hierarchy
(e.g. <code>public.text</code> conforms to both <code>public.data</code> <em>and</em>
<code>public.content</code>), and Apple provides APIs that allow you to test any
given UTI for conformance with any other UTI.</p>

<p>Additionally, every UTI has associated with it a set of <em>tags</em>.  These
are things like file extensions, MIME types and Mac OS <code>OSType</code> codes,
and each class of tag is identified by—you guessed it—a UTI.  So,
the UTI for a file extension is <code>public.filename-extension</code>, for a
MIME type it’s <code>public.mime-type</code> and for an <code>OSType</code> it’s
<code>com.apple.ostype</code>.  Again, APIs are provided that allow you to ask,
given a UTI, e.g. what the file extension might be for that UTI.</p>

<p>Finally, Apple’s platform allows applications to declare their own UTIs by
adding information to their <code>Info.plist</code> files, which makes them
accessible to all applications on the system.</p>

<p>So what, you ask?  Well here’s the really clever part; there’s an API
that, given a tag class and a tag will find you the most appropriate
UTI.  For instance, if you give it <code>public.filename-extension</code> and
<code>jpeg</code>, it will return <code>public.jpeg</code>.  However, sometimes you’ll have
a file that the system doesn’t recognize; <em>you</em> might know something
about it (e.g. it’s file extension), but it isn’t in the system’s UTI
database, and no application has mentioned it in their <code>Info.plist</code>.
What happens now?  Well, if, for instance, you ask for the UTI for a
file you’ve found with the extension <code>frob</code>, you’ll get back a rather
cryptic looking answer: <code>dyn.age80q6xtqk</code>.</p>

<p>The neat part about this odd-looking UTI is that
<em>the information you gave the system is still there</em>.  If you ask any
Mac or iOS device for the file extension for <code>dyn.age80q6xtqk</code>, it
will immediately tell you: <code>frob</code>.  You could transmit this UTI across
a network, and <em>it would still tell you</em> when you ask, that the
extension is <code>frob</code>.</p>

<p>This runs slightly deeper, though.  When you ask for a UTI, you can
specify that it must conform to a particular type.  Maybe you know
that your <code>frob</code> file is really some kind of <code>public.text</code>?  In that
case, you might instead get the answer: <code>dyn.ah62d4r34ge80q6xtqk</code>.
You might be able to guess that this new UTI <em>also</em> knows that it
conforms to <code>public.text</code>, and again, any Mac or iOS device presented
with this UTI will be able to tell you so.</p>

<p>Why is this feature useful?  Well, web server administrators will have
seen the unusual behaviour of various client systems when their server
doesn’t know the correct MIME type for a file; some systems try to
guess from the file extension, while others throw their hands up and
treat the file as raw data (which is probably but not necessarily the
default on any given web server).  If the web used UTIs instead, the
UTI would preserve all of the information the server <em>did</em> have, which
would result in an improved experience in some cases.</p>

<p>What Apple doesn’t tell you is that these dynamic UTIs can actually
hold more than just a single tag class.  For example, the UTI</p>

<pre><code>dyn.ah62d4r34gq81k3p2su1zuppgsm10esvvhzxhe55c
</code></pre>

<p>has a MIME type (<code>text/X-frob</code>), and a file extension (<code>frob</code>) as well
as stipulating conformance to <code>public.text</code>.  There’s no API on Mac OS
X or iOS that will construct this UTI for you, mind… so how did I do
it?</p>

<p>Well, the first thing you need to know is that all dynamic UTIs
currently start with the string <code>dyn.a</code>.  The first part, <code>dyn.</code>
identifies the fact that it’s a dynamically generated UTI; the ‘a’ is,
I’m guessing, a format identifier (so if you’re parsing these UTIs
yourself, you <strong>must</strong> check that it’s an ‘a’ and not any other
character; if it isn’t an ‘a’, you should indicate that you don’t
understand the UTI).</p>

<p>Strip that off, and we have a funny looking string, which, it turns
out, is encoded in a custom form of base-32 encoding using the
encoding vector</p>

<pre><code>abcdefghkmnpqrstuvwxyz0123456789
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s decode the dynamic UTI above and see what it contains; feeding
the string</p>

<pre><code>h62d4r34gq81k3p2su1zuppgsm10esvvhzxhe55c
</code></pre>

<p>through a custom base-32 decoder, we get</p>

<pre><code>?0=7:3=text/X-frob:1=frob
</code></pre>

<p>Hmmm.  Let’s look at another example; say we have a custom tag class
<code>com.example.SpecialType</code>… let’s generate a UTI with that.  Here it
is:</p>

<pre><code>dyn.ah62d4r34qr104pxftbu046dqqy1fg6dfqry0c5cytf2gntpgr710e2pw
</code></pre>

<p>Yikes!  That’s a lot longer.  What happened?  Well, decoding it, we
see</p>

<pre><code>?0=7:com.example.SpecialType=foobar
</code></pre>

<p>Aha.  So these are key-value pairs with the tag class and tag
respectively.  What about that funny ?0=7 on the front?  Well, when I
created this UTI I said it conformed to <code>public.text</code>.  What if it
conforms instead to <code>com.example.Borked</code>?  Now I get</p>

<pre><code>dyn.ah62d425try1gn8dbrz2g23mskm11e45fqu7gg55rf3w1u2prsb0gnpwxsbw0g4pbrvnhw6dfhzxg855cqf3a
</code></pre>

<p>which decodes to</p>

<pre><code>?0=com.example.Borked:com.example.SpecialType=foobar
</code></pre>

<p>Hmmm.  So <code>?0</code> means “the UTI we conform to”, right?  So ‘7’ must mean
<code>public.text</code>…</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that the system has a built-in list of UTIs that
get abbreviated to the hexadecimal digits ‘0’ through ‘F’.  They are:</p>

<pre><code>0: UTTypeConformsTo
1: public.filename-extension
2: com.apple.ostype
3: public.mime-type
4: com.apple.nspboard-type
5: public.url-scheme
6: public.data
7: public.text
8: public.plain-text
9: public.utf16-plain-text
A: com.apple.traditional-mac-plain-text
B: public.image
C: public.video
D: public.audio
E: public.directory
F: public.folder
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can understand the string we saw earlier;</p>

<pre><code>?0=7:3=text/X-frob:1=frob
</code></pre>

<p>expands to</p>

<pre><code>?UTTypeConformsTo=public.text:public.mime-type=text/X-frob:public.filename-extension=frob
</code></pre>

<p>There are, as ever, a couple of niggles.  The first is that tags might
in general contain special characters (for instance, ‘=’ signs) that
would mess us up.  What does the UTI system do about these?  It
escapes them, that’s what.  The set of characters that are escaped is:</p>

<pre><code>, : = \ NUL
</code></pre>

<p>The ‘,’ is interesting; it turns out that each of the keys in the
string can have more than one value associated with them.  That is,
it’s legal for the UTI to encode something like</p>

<pre><code>?0=7,B:3=text/X-frob,image/X-frob:1=frob
</code></pre>

<p>resulting in something like</p>

<pre><code>dyn.ah62d4r3qkk7dgtpyqz6hkp42fzxhe55cfvy042phqy1zuppgsm10esvvhzxhe55c
</code></pre>

<p>If you ask the system about this UTI, you’ll find that it conforms to
<em>both</em> <code>public.text</code> and <code>public.image</code>, in spite of the fact that
neither type conforms to the other.  Unfortunately, Apple only
provides a way to copy the <em>preferred</em> tag given a tag class and a
UTI, so if you ask for its MIME type, you’ll only get <code>text/X-frob</code>
(the first one, as per the documentation).</p>

<p>So, in summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We’ve seen that UTIs can encapsulate <em>any</em> kind of type
information, not just the obvious ones like file extensions.  You
can define your own type information, entirely orthogonal to the
set Apple uses, if you like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’ve seen that conformance information allows programs using UTIs
to determine that (for instance) they know how to handle data with a UTI
they’ve <em>never even seen before</em> because it conforms to a UTI they
do understand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’ve seen that it’s possible to generate dynamic UTIs that will
remember the information with which they were created even when
passed to another system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’ve seen how these dynamic are generated, and the mechanism by
which they hold the information given when they were created.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re interested in reading Apple’s documentation, you might find
their <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/understanding_utis/understand_utis_intro/understand_utis_intro.html">Uniform Type Identifiers Overview</a>
informative.  Note that the format of the dynamic UTIs is
<em>undocumented</em>.  If you are going to rely on the information I
presented above, <strong>make sure you check that they start <code>dyn.a</code></strong> and
<strong>do not</strong> assume that you understand any dynamic UTI that has a
different format identifier.</p>
